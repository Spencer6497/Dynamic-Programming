    HW2: Dynamic Programming
    Dr. Jeff Ward

    This program prompts the user for a number of work weeks available, the name of the
    input and output files, reads the available projects from the input file, solves the
    corresponding knapsack problem (without repetition), and writes to the output file
    a summary of the results, including expected profit and a list of the best projects
    for the company to undertake.
